*🥒 AI-driven pre- and postoperative care assistant—because recovery (and preparation) shouldn’t leave you in a pickle!*

> **Why “Pickle”?**  
> In hospitals, the “pickle” is slang for the on-call phone—passed between residents, nurses, and staff responsible for urgent care. We’re reclaiming the term with a digital twist: a chatbot that’s always on-call. 📟🥒

## 🧠 What We Do

Pickle is building an AI-powered medical chatbot to support patients before and after surgery. Our assistant guides patients through both preparation and recovery, simplifies instructions, answers questions in real time, and monitors symptoms to flag complications early—all without missing a beat.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Pre- and postoperative care are critical but often poorly managed. Patients struggle with confusing instructions, while providers are overwhelmed with follow-up questions. Our solution helps reduce readmissions, prevent emergency visits, and ease the burden on healthcare teams. 🏥✨

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🕒 24/7 physician-bespoke chatbot guidance for patients  
- 📊 Real-time symptom tracking and alerts  
- 🧵 Custom responses tailored to procedure type and physician preference 
- 📞 Escalation workflows with immediate redirection to a healthcare provider as needed  
- 🔌 Integration-ready with EHRs and hospital systems  

We make sure no one gets left in a **healthcare brine**.

## 🩺 Our Product: Helping Patients and Providers

Pickle isn’t just a chatbot—it’s a companion through the care journey. For patients, it reduces confusion, anxiety, and unnecessary calls or visits. For providers, it means fewer after-hours calls, more consistent follow-up, and insight into patient recovery trends. We believe in closing the communication loop between those who give care and those who need it.

## 👥 Meet Our Team

We’re a small but mighty team of clinicians, patients, and engineers building Pickle from lived experience. We know what it’s like to be on-call, to get the 3AM “is this normal?” text, and to wish you could clone yourself during discharge. Now we’re building the tool we always wished we had. 🛠️💚
