*🥒 AI-driven pre- and postoperative care assistant—because recovery (and preparation) shouldn’t leave you in a pickle!*

> **Why “Pickle”?**  
> In hospitals, the “pickle” is slang for the on-call phone—passed between residents, nurses, and staff responsible for urgent care. We’re reclaiming the term with a digital twist: a chatbot that’s always on-call. 📟🥒

## 🧠 What We Do

Pickle is building an AI-powered medical chatbot to support patients before and after surgery. Our assistant guides patients through both preparation and recovery, simplifies instructions, answers questions in real time, and monitors symptoms to flag complications early—all without missing a beet 🥬 (or a pickle).

## 💡 Why It Matters

Pre- and postoperative care are critical but often poorly managed. Patients struggle with confusing instructions, while providers are overwhelmed with follow-up questions. Our solution helps reduce readmissions, prevent emergency visits, and ease the burden on healthcare teams. 🏥✨
