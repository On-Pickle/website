Pickle is building an AI-powered medical chatbot to support patients before and after surgery. Our assistant guides patients through both preparation and recovery, simplifies instructions, answers questions in real time, and monitors symptoms to flag complications early—all without missing a beet 🥬 (or a pickle).

## 💡 Why It Matters

Pre- and postoperative care are critical but often poorly managed. Patients struggle with confusing instructions, while providers are overwhelmed with follow-up questions. Our solution helps reduce readmissions, prevent emergency visits, and ease the burden on healthcare teams. 🏥✨

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🕒 24/7 chatbot guidance for patients  
- 📊 Real-time symptom tracking and alerts  
- 🧵 Custom responses tailored to procedure type  
- 📞 Escalation workflows for medical concerns  
- 🔌 Integration-ready with EHRs and hospital systems  

We make sure no one gets left in a **healthcare brine**.
